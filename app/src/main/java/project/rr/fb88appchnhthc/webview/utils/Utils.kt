            "The development of modern football was closely tied to processes of industrialization and urbanization in Victorian Britain." +
                    " Most of the new working-class inhabitants of Britain’s industrial towns and cities gradually lost their old bucolic pastimes," +
                    " such as badger-baiting, and sought fresh forms of collective leisure. From the 1850s onward," +
                    " industrial workers were increasingly likely to have Saturday afternoons off work, " +
                    "and so many turned to the new game of football to watch or to play. Key urban institutions such as churches," +
                    " trade unions, and schools organized working-class boys and men into recreational football teams." +
                    " Rising adult literacy spurred press coverage of organized sports, while transport systems such as" +
                    " the railways or urban trams enabled players and spectators to travel to football games." +
                    " Average attendance in England rose from 4,600 in 1888 to 7,900 in 1895, rising to 13,200 in 1905 and reaching" +

            "By the early 20th century, football had spread across Europe, but it was in need of" +
                    " international organization. A solution was found in 1904, when representatives from the football associations of Belgium," +
                    " Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland founded the Fédération Internationale de Football Association" +

                    " FIFA members accepted British control over the rules of football via the International Board," +
                    " which had been established by the home nations in 1882. Nevertheless, in 1920 the British associations resigned their" +

                    " The British associations rejoined FIFA in 1924 but soon after insisted" +
                    " upon a very rigid definition of amateurism, notably for Olympic football." +
                    " Other nations again failed to follow their lead, and the British resigned once more in 1928," +
                    " remaining outside FIFA until 1946. When FIFA established the World Cup championship," +
                    " British insouciance toward the international game continued. Without membership in FIFA," +

                    " A game lasts 90 minutes and is divided into halves; the halftime interval lasts 15 minutes, during which the teams change ends." +
                    " Additional time may be added by the referee to compensate for stoppages in play (for example, player injuries)." +
                    " If neither side wins, and if a victor must be established, “extra-time” is played," +
                    " and then, if required, a series of penalty kicks may be taken.",

            "Free kicks are awarded for fouls or violations of rules; when a free kick is taken, all players of the offending" +
                    " side must be 10 yards (9 metres) from the ball. Free kicks may be either direct (from which a goal may be scored)," +

                    " for particularly serious fouls, such as violent conduct.",

            "There were few major alterations to football’s laws through the 20th century. Indeed, until the changes of the 1990s," +
                    " the most significant amendment to the rules came in 1925, when the offside rule was rewritten." +
                    " Previously, an attacking player (i.e., one in the opponent’s half of the playing field) was offside if," +
                    " when the ball was “played” to him, fewer than three opposing players were between him and the goal. The rule change," +
                    " which reduced the required number of intervening players to two, was effective in promoting more goals." +
                    " In response, new defensive tactics and team formations emerged. Player substitutions were introduced in 1965;" +
                    " teams have been allowed to field three substitutes since 1995.",

            "Use of the feet and (to a lesser extent) the legs to control and pass the ball is football’s most basic skill." +
                    " Heading the ball is particularly prominent when receiving long aerial passes. " +
                    "Since the game’s origins, players have displayed their individual skills by going on “solo runs”" +
                    " or dribbling the ball past outwitted opponents. But football is essentially a team game based" +
                    " on passing between team members. The basic playing styles and skills of individual players" +
                    " reflect their respective playing positions. Goalkeepers require agility and height to reach and" +

                    " corner kicks, they are usually big and strong. Fullbacks are typically smaller but quicker," +
                    " qualities required to match speedy wing-forwards. Midfield players (also called halfs or halfbacks)" +
                    " operate across the middle of the field and may have a range of qualities: powerful “ball-winners” " +
                    "need to be “good in the tackle” in terms of winning or protecting the ball and energetic runners; " +
                    "creative “playmakers” develop scoring chances through their talent at holding the ball and through accurate passing.",

            "England and Scotland had the first leagues, but clubs sprang up in most European nations in the 1890s and 1900s," +
                    " enabling these nations to found their own leagues. Many Scottish professional players" +
                    " migrated south to join English clubs, introducing English players and audiences to more-advanced" +
                    " ball-playing skills and to the benefits of teamwork and passing. Up to World War II," +
                    " the British continued to influence football’s development through regular club tours overseas" +
                    " and the Continental coaching careers of former players. Itinerant Scots were particularly" +
                    " prominent in central Europe. The interwar Danubian school of football emerged from the" +
                    " coaching legacies and expertise of John Madden in Prague and Jimmy Hogan in Austria.",

            "Football first came to South America in the 19th century through the port of Buenos Aires, Argentina," +
                    " where European sailors played the game. Members of the British community there formed the first club," +
                    " the Buenos Aires Football Club (FC), in 1867; about the same time, British railway workers started another club," +
                    " in the town of Rosario, Argentina. The first Argentinian league championship was played in 1893," +
                    " but most of the players belonged to the British community, a pattern that continued until the early 20th century.",

            "European sailors, soldiers, traders, engineers, and missionaries brought football with them to Africa in the second half" +
                    " of the 19th century. The first documented match took place in Cape Town in 1862, after which the game spread rapidly" +
                    " throughout the continent, particularly in the British colonies and in societies with vibrant indigenous athletic traditions.",

            "The spread of football throughout the globe has brought together people from diverse cultures in celebration of a shared passion for the game," +
                    " but it has also spawned a worldwide epidemic of spectator hooliganism. High emotions that sometimes escalate into violence," +
                    " both on and off the field, have always been a part of the game, but concern with fan violence" +
                    " and hooliganism has intensified since the 1960s. The early focus of this concern was British fans," +
                    " but the development of the anti-hooligan architecture of football grounds around the world points" +
                    " to the international scope of the problem. Stadiums in Latin America are constructed with moats and high fences." +
                    " Many grounds in Europe now ban alcohol and no longer offer sections where fans can stand; those" +
                    " “terraces,” which charged lower admission than ticketed seating, were the traditional flash points of fan violence.",

            "Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been" +
                    " played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and urbanization," +
                    " which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class," +

                    "(independent) schools such as Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton. Each school had its own rules;" +
                    " some allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not. The variance in rules " +
                    "made it difficult for public schoolboys entering university to continue playing except" +
                    " with former schoolmates. As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of play was made" +
                    " at the University of Cambridge, whose students joined most public schools in 1848 in adopting these “Cambridge rules,”" +
                    " which were further spread by Cambridge graduates who formed football clubs."
